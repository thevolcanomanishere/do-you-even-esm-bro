# Modern Typescript + ESM + Jest starter project

Trying to get the simplest of Typescript projects going and can't figure out what the magic combination of commands, packages,  and config files is? Me too. So I made this.

## Commands

`yarn start` - Compiles and runs with Node.

`yarn watch` - Compiles, watches for changes, restarts on changes and runs with nodemon.

`yarn test` - Runs Jest tests.

`yarn test:coverage` - Runs Jest tests and outputs coverage.
