# ✨ Modern Typescript + ESM + Vitest ✨

Trying to get the simplest of Typescript projects going and can't figure out what the magic combination of commands, packages,  and config files is? Me too. So I made this.

## Commands

`yarn start` - Compiles and runs with tsx.

`yarn watch` - Compiles, watches for changes, restarts on changes and runs with tsx.

`yarn test` - Runs Vitest tests.

`yarn test:ui` - Runs Vitest ui.
